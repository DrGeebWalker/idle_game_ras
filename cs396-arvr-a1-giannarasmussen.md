# A0: Hello Web
### Your name:

 Gianna Rasmussen
 
### Which idle game(s) did you play?

Particle Clicker, Candy Box 2

### Which readings you did:

The Curse of Cow Clicker. How a Cheeky Satire Became a Videogame Hit.


### Your 3 insights from the readings 

Different objects to buy to click are enticing, which is why I did different cheeses.

Greed is dangerous and leads to fear. Zyngda used to take chances, but now it is mostly reskins and a boat load of adds.
 
Apparently mindless tasks being appealing is a recent discovery. A pointless clicker game sounds like a no brainer. 
 
### What are your 3+ currencies
 Bite Score
 Taste Score
 Stink Score
 
 
### What are your 3+ buyable things
 
 Monterey, Blue Cheese, Cream Cheese, Maggot Cheese

### What events happen?
 
 Every 4000 stink score goes up and taste score goes down regaurdless of cheese.

 If you are clicking monterey, the tastescore adds 10 to taste and 2 to bite every 4000.

 If you are on blue cheese bite score goes up by 3 and stink score goes up by 20 every 4000.

 If you are on cream cheese bite score goes up by 20 and taste score goes up by 20 every 4000.

 If you are on casu martzu (the maggot cheese) stink score goes up by 100, taste score goes down by 20, creature score goes up by 100, and bite score goes down by 90 every 4000.
